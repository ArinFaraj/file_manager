# file_manager

A simple & fast file manager for desktop 

## Main Goals

- Very Simple UI
- Keyboard shortcuts for everything
- Custom context menu
- Similar shortcuts to Visual Studio Code
- Hopefully a replacement for the OS default file manager 
## Todo

- [ ] Create repository for supplying items
  - [ ] Use Stream to get the results so that we get a cached version before the actual version
- [ ] Create the main page
  - [ ] Research on the best way to focus items
    - [ ] either by overriding the actual focusing system
    - [ ] or by creating a bloc for focus
- [ ] Create the command palette 
  - [ ]  Should remember the last command search and scroll position
  - [ ]  If it had previous search text it should be selected
  - [ ]  Use arrows to move up and down
